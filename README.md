This is the Project 6 of the Junior Web Developer path of Tristan Monget.

### Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node (https://nodejs.org/en/) and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Installation ###

Clone this repo.
For the frontend from within the project folder dwj-projet6-master, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `npm start`.
For the backend from within the project folder backend, run `npm install` and after launch run `nodemon`.
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

### Use ###

Open http://localhost:4200/.
